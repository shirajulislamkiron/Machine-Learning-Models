# Machine learning models

The models are made by Machine Learning algorithms like Regressions, classifier algorithms and tree based algorithms. This notebook files are made for classify different kind of topics such as car price prediction,
gold price prediction , calogies detection and many others. Those files can be used in daily files by people to predict results. Using csv dataset they can train and test ML models easily.


## Appendix

It's a part of Machine Learning, For Using this project it must need datasets, algorithms and high performance computer
